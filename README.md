# MoveWatch

## Description
I intend to make a biomedical device that helps Michelle make changes to her sedentary lifestyle to decrease her high risk for cardiovascular disease. From using my device, Michelle will decrease her risk of cardiovascular disease as it is scientifically proven that taking time to walk instead of sitting each day decreases it. The gauge bar and step counter will make Michelle be more aware of her responsibility to be active and motivate her to fill all 10 bars and 7000 steps. The recommended amount of steps adults should take daily is 10 000 steps. Since Michelle is not a very active person and is very busy, she will walk half the amount each day. This serves as a starting point to push her to exercise more so in the future she will have the motivation to move more herself and improve her health.
